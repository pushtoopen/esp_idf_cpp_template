ESP-IDF C++ template app
====================

Standard ESP-IDF info:
This is a template application to be used with [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

Please check [ESP-IDF docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for getting started instructions.



This template is generated using the Eclipse ESP-IDF project generator so that it is easier to import this into the latest eclipse that uses ESP-IDF.

Credit Simon Howroyd for making nice youtube walkthroughs for building this template:

This template is a little closer to the standard architecture of an esp-idf C template than Simon's preference

This template has extreme basic comments in it so that C programmers transitioning can understand the basics of C++ within this context.
